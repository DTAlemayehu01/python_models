# Modeling Ideal Gas Law Concentration

# Information

Dependencies (Make sure you have these Installed):
- python
- numpy
- plotly
- scipy

Other info:
- This model utilizes the plotly library to generate the graph
- The resulting html generated is significant in size (~500Mb) and needs to be opened in a browser with WebGL enabled
- This script can take awhile to generate the graph

# Instructions for generating model

1. Copy/Download the `Concentration.py` script contents
2. Run it with `python path/filename.py`
  - Where `path/filename.py` is the local path to the script
3. After a bit a file named `Concentration.html` should be generated in the folder where the script is located
4. Open the html browser and take a look at the interactive model!
